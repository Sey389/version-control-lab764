This is Sage, Nick and Anshul's version control lab
In our code we are asking for the user to input their name and age(integer) and then we are finding the users birth year by asking them what the current year is and then subtracting that number by their age. Next we are determining what a person's username should be by creating a string that combines their birth year with their name.
Lastly we are printing Hello + (what ever the person's name is) + you are + (what ever the person's age is) + years old! and then in the same line we are printing you were born in (what ever year they were born).
On the lastl line we are adding to together and printing what a person's name is plus their birth year.
